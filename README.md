## About
Bridgely is an iOS app that aims to streamline the decision making process of bridge construction project, by providing a convenient and centralized tool to access all bridge data
in the State of California. All data are mapped on Apple Map with an intuitive user interface, in which the user can access bridge data of any county and data of any individual 
bridge, similar to accessing housing data in Zillow or in AirBnB. The bridge data shown in this app are all obtained from the public database of FHWA (Federal Highway Adminstration),
which are cleaned up and re-organized using Python.
